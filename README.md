# Algorithms and Data Structures in JavaScript

In my continuing effort to become more proficient with both TDD and algorithms, I'm setting up this
repo to be my dumping ground for algorithms implemented in JavaScript. I use Mocha / Chai as the
testing framework.

This collection exists as an academic exercise for myself, and for anyone who might want to see how
another software engineer might implement these algorithms in JavaScript. I'd caution against using them in production code; I'd bet you can find more performant implementations elsewhere.

## Installation

In your project: ``` $ npm install --save compscijs ```

## Documentation



## Development

``` $ npm install ```

To run the tests:

``` $ npm test ```

I'm also using this repo to experiment with automated documentation generation for ES6 classes. I'm currently
using esdocs for this. To generate the docs:

``` $ npm run docgen ```

To view the documentation:

``` $ npm run docs ```

(Or you can just open docs/index.html in your favorite browser.)
