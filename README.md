# Algorithms and Data Structures in JavaScript

In my continuing effort to become more proficient with both TDD and algorithms, I'm setting up this
repo to be my dumping ground for algorithms implemented in JavaScript. I use Mocha / Chai as the
testing framework.

## Installation

``` $ npm install ```

To run the tests:

``` $ npm test ```

## Documentation

I'm also using this repo to experiment with automated documentation generation for ES6 classes. I'm currently
using esdocs for this. To generate the docs:

``` $ npm run docgen ```

To view the documentation:

``` $ npm run docs ```

(Or you can just open docs/index.html in your favorite browser.)
